# FRR ICP Patterns - FedRAMP 20x Requirements
# Family: ICP
# Pattern Type: Process-Based Requirements
# Schema: V2
#
# These patterns represent FedRAMP Requirements (FRR) which are
# primarily process-based and require documentation, policies,
# and procedures rather than code-level detection.
#
# NOTE: Manual completion required for:
# - Automation implementation code
# - Organization-specific policy details
# - Evidence collection procedures

    Formats), you SHOULD consider implementing the following recommended practices:


    1. Review FedRAMP 20x requirement documentation

    2. Identify systems and resources in scope

    3. Create resource group for FedRAMP resources

    4. Set up Azure Key Vault for secrets management

    5. Configure Log Analytics workspace
