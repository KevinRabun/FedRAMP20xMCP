# FRR ADS Patterns - FedRAMP 20x Requirements
# Family: ADS
# Pattern Type: Process-Based Requirements

#
# These patterns represent FedRAMP Requirements (FRR) which are
# primarily process-based and require documentation, policies,
# and procedures rather than code-level detection.
#
# NOTE: Manual completion required for:
# - Automation implementation code
# - Organization-specific policy details
# - Evidence collection procedures
