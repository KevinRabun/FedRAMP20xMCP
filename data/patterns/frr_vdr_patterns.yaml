# FRR VDR Patterns - FedRAMP 20x Requirements
# Family: VDR
# Pattern Type: Process-Based Requirements
# Schema: V2
#
# These patterns represent FedRAMP Requirements (FRR) which are
# primarily process-based and require documentation, policies,
# and procedures rather than code-level detection.
#
# NOTE: Manual completion required for:
# - Automation implementation code
# - Organization-specific policy details
# - Evidence collection procedures

  and identify _vulnerabilities_ within their _cloud service offering_ using appropriate
  techniques such as assessment, scanning, threat intelligence, vulnerability disclosure
  mechanisms, bug bounties, supply chain monitoring, and other relevant capabilities;
  this process is called _vulnerability detection_.
